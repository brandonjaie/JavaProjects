### About:

DVD Library contains CRUD functionality for DVDs and features RESTful endpoints that utilize AJAX calls to interact with the server, and endpoints that do not utilize JavaScript. It also features modal windows, a "partial search" functionality for DVDs, and a stats page built with Google Charts components that allows a user to view the number of DVDs in the library by genre.
